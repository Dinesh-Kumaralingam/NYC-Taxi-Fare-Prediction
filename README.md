NYC Taxi Ride Analysis

## Question: What are the key insights from real-world taxi rides in New York City?

## Description:

I analyze real-world taxi ride data from New York City to identify key trends, patterns, and influencing factors. I explore metrics such as ride duration, fare prices, trip distances, and demand fluctuations. Using statistical and machine learning techniques, I provide actionable insights into taxi ride behaviors.

### Methods and Analysis:

* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Statistical Tests (e.g., ANOVA, correlation analysis)
* Regression Models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
* Visualization using graphs and maps

### Required Packages:

1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. scikit-learn
6. geopandas
7. folium

### Key Findings:

* Identification of peak hours and busiest locations
* Correlation between fare prices and trip distances
* Seasonal and weather-based ride demand variations
* Predictive modeling of fare prices with Random Forest (RMSE â‰ˆ \$5.25)

### Summary:

This project analyzes real-world taxi ride data from New York City to identify key trends, patterns, and influencing factors. I explore metrics such as ride duration, fare prices, trip distances, and demand fluctuations. Using statistical and machine learning techniques, I provide actionable insights into taxi ride behaviors. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to understand urban mobility patterns.
